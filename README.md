# VisiMark: Intelligent Facial Attendance Tracker
VESIT MCA Mini-Project

"VisiMark: Intelligent Facial Attendance Tracker" is an innovative and advanced project that aims to revolutionize attendance management in educational institutions. The system addresses the complexities and inefficiencies associated with manual attendance processes, offering an automated and accurate solution through the integration of computer vision techniques and the powerful OpenCV library. 

The project comprises two main components: the frontend and backend. The frontend component focuses on designing an intuitive and responsive interface that allows students to access their attendance records and administrators to manage attendance effortlessly. The backend component incorporates complex logic, including facial recognition algorithms and integration with the existing VESIT database system.
